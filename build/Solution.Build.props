      - ArtifactsPath
        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/sdk/artifacts-output
          https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/867

      - OutputPath vs. OutDir
        https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/87
          https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/pull/4608

      - BaseIntermediateOutputPath is not scoped by default
        as it's located within the project (MSBuildProjectName) folder.

        BaseIntermediateOutputPath is predefined as follows:

          <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>obj\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>

        BaseIntermediateOutputPath is re-scoped per project (MSBuildProjectName)
        and re-defined as follows:

          <BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath>$(ArtifactsFolderPath)$(IntermediateOutputFolderName)\</BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath>

          <BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath>$(BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath)$(MSBuildProjectName)\</BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath>
          <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>$(BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath)</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>

      - MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath is not scoped by default
        as it's located within the project (MSBuildProjectName) folder.
        It refers to BaseIntermediateOutputPath by default.

        NuGet uses MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath as RestoreOutputPath.
        https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/issues/853
          https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/pull/854
        https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4463
        https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks/NuGet.targets
          https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks/NuGet.targets#L795

        Thus, it contains, at least, the following files:
        - project.assets.json
        - project.nuget.cache
        - [ProjectName].csproj.nuget.dgspec.json
        - [ProjectName].csproj.nuget.g.props
        - [ProjectName].csproj.nuget.g.targets

        NuGet also further uses MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath as temporary (intermediate) output folder path
        for NuGet specification files (.nuspec) of the project NuGet package,
        by automatically appending Configuration at the end of the path.
        That new path contains, at least, the following files:
        - [ProjectPackageId].[ProjectPackageVersion].nuspec
        - [ProjectPackageId].[ProjectPackageVersion].symbols.nuspec

        MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath is predefined as follows:

          <MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath>$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)</MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath>

        MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath is re-scoped per project (MSBuildProjectName)
        and re-defined as follows:

          <BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath>$(ArtifactsFolderPath)$(IntermediateOutputFolderName)\</BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath>

          <BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath>$(BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath)$(MSBuildProjectName)\</BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath>
          <MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath>$(BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath)</MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath>

      NOTE:   There seems to be an known issue with .NET Framework 4.8 WPF project
              when overriding MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath.
              https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/5679

      - IntermediateOutputPath is always scoped per target framework (TargetFramework), eg: net8.0, net48, etc.

        MSBuild uses IntermediateOutputPath as temporary (intermediate) output folder path ('obj' folder).
        When overridden, Configuration must be EXPLICITLY specified within the path,
        along with MSBuildProjectName.

        IntermediateOutputPath has a certain, predefined folder structure,
        where it MUST contain MSBuildProjectName, Configuration, and TargetFramework in exact order.
        TargetFramework will automatically be appended at the end of the IntermediateOutputPath,
        thus it should NOT be manually specified anywhere within the path.
        It's unlike OutputPath, where folder structure can be freely specified,
        including TargetFramework that can be specified anywhere within the path.

        IntermediateOutputPath is predefined as follows:

          <IntermediateOutputPath>$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)$(Configuration)\[$(TargetFramework)\]</IntermediateOutputPath>

        IntermediateOutputPath is re-defined as follows:

          <BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath>$(ArtifactsFolderPath)$(IntermediateOutputFolderName)\</BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath>
          <BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath>$(BaseIntermediateOutputBaseFolderPath)$(MSBuildProjectName)\</BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath>

          <IntermediateOutputFolderPath>$(BaseIntermediateOutputFolderPath)$(Configuration)\[$(TargetFramework)\]</IntermediateOutputFolderPath>
          <IntermediateOutputPath>$(IntermediateOutputFolderPath)</IntermediateOutputPath>

      - BaseOutputPath is not scoped by default
        as it's located within the project (MSBuildProjectName) folder.

        MSBuild uses BaseOutputPath as base folder path ('bin' folder) for OutputPath and OutDir.

        BaseOutputPath is predefined as follows:

          <BaseOutputPath>bin\</BaseOutputPath>

        BaseOutputPath is re-defined as follows:

          <BaseOutputBaseFolderPath>$(ArtifactsFolderPath)$(OutputFolderName)\</BaseOutputBaseFolderPath>

          <BaseOutputFolderPath>$(BaseOutputBaseFolderPath)</BaseOutputFolderPath>
          <BaseOutputPath>$(BaseOutputFolderPath)</BaseOutputPath>

      - OutputPath is, by default, scoped per target framework (TargetFramework), eg: net8.0, net48, etc.,
        because AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath is set to 'true' by default.
        That way, even though OutputPath has been specified with TargetFramework already,
        TargetFramework will always be appended at the end of the path,
        as long as AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath is NOT set to 'false'.

        OutputPath is predefined as follows:

          <OutputPath>$(BaseOutputPath)$(Configuration)\[$(TargetFramework)\]</OutputPath>

        OutDir is, by default, scoped per target framework (TargetFramework), eg: net8.0, net48, etc.
        AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath doesn't affect OutDir.

        OutDir is predefined as follows:

          <OutDir>$(BaseOutputPath)$(Configuration)\[$(TargetFramework)\]</OutDir>

        OutputPath and OutDir are re-scoped per project (MSBuildProjectName)
        and re-defined as follows:

          <OutputBaseFolderPath>$(BaseOutputBaseFolderPath)$(Configuration)\$(TargetFramework)\</OutputBaseFolderPath>

          <OutputFolderPath>$(OutputBaseFolderPath)$(MSBuildProjectName)\</OutputFolderPath>
          <OutputPath>$(OutputFolderPath)[$(TargetFramework)\]</OutputPath>
          <OutDir>$(OutputFolderPath)</OutDir>
